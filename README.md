# Credit_Risk_Modelling

## Objective
This project involves the building of a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of an FCMB customer subscribing to a product offered by the bank. The model serves as an aide to organisers of marketing campaigns by providing a filter for these campaigns. The objective of the project is to determine the degree of interest a potential customer might have in a specific product using data that contains cases where distinct customers have or have not acquired that product. The model then takes this data in and determines how likely a customer is to acquire a product, if the customer has a high propensity(likelihood) to get the produxt, the poduct is then recommended.

## Background
In the competitive landscape of the banking industry, understanding customer behaviour and predicting their preferences is crucial for targeted marketing and personalised product recommendations. In cases where banks fail to adopt certain techniques to determine the interest of customers in a product, losses are made due to low interest in financial products amongst targeted clients. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, the product propensity model empowers banks to optimise their marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase cross-selling and upselling opportunities.
